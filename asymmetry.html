	        <p> The first time I read about the Pareto principle was when I was reading something that said how 80% of your results come from 20% of 
		studying.(They didn't say which 20% so I ignored it as useless.)<br><br>


		Later, while I was reading Nassim Taleb's Incerto, I came across the idea of applying the 80-20 rule recursively, to the point that 
		it essentially operates as the 99-1 rule.<br>
		Explains a lot of things: the 99% wealth concentrated in the hands of 1% of people/99% value created by 1% people(depending upon your politics), 
		the successful companies from the portfolios of VCs, reproductive mechanisms across species, the matter to empty space ratio
		of atoms and even the universe, the percentage of your work that is going to make you money(creators)so on and so forth.<br><br>
		

		
		Now this rule has become the mombo-jumbo of pop culture along side Compound Interest, Atomic Habits, Deep Work, et cetera.<br>
		But like the other terms, it suffers from the old 'who bells the cat' problem. Everyone knows the solutions to most common
		problems we face or what to do in most situations, but it's difficult to act on them.<br><br>



		Some instances of Asymmetry I have incorporated in my life:
			
		<br><br> 
		
			
		<h6>Time restricted eating:</h6>
		(Here, relegate 99% of your eating in a small part of the day)
		You relegate the decision to measure portions of your food to your stomach size instead of letting it depend on your whims 
		and moods and uncertain willpower.<br>
		A person who tries to balance 2200 calories across multiple meals can never be more consistent long term than a person who restricts
		eating to within a few hours. 

		<br><br>


		<h6>Diet:</h6>
		You should be eating the same simple wholesome food with minor rearrangements for 95% of the time, while eating literally 
		anything for the rest 5% of the time. (In an year, that computes to around 18-20 days)


		<br><br>


		<h6>Reading a great book:</h6>
		You read hundreds of different books to find the one(or more) that is personally life transforming for you.
		And often, the rest prepare you for that one book.<br>
		(You need to be careful here that no book, no matter how good and how true it seems to you, should become your Bible, 
		including the Bible, Quran, Upanishads/Bhagwat Gita, The Torah, etc)
