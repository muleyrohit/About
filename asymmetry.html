	     <h5 text-align="left">ASYMMETRY</h5>
	      <br>
	      
	        <p> The first time I read about the Pareto Principle was when I was reading something that said how 80% of your results come from 20% of 
		studying. It stuck me as true, but I didn't pay much heed. Later, while I was reading Nassim Taleb's Incerto, I came across the idea 
		of applying the 80-20 rule recursively, to the point that it essentially operates as the 95-5 rule, or even 99-1 rule.<br>
		In this form, it explains a lot of things: the 99% wealth concentrated in the hands of 1% of people or 99% value created by 1% people
		(depending upon your politics), the uber-successful companies from the portfolios of VCs, reproductive mechanisms across species, the matter 
		to empty space ratio of atoms and even the universe, the percentage of your work that is going to make you money if you are a creator, 
		or more realistic, the percentage of creators whose work makes any money, so on and so forth.
		</p>
	      
	      <br><br>
			
			
			
			
		<p>	
		Now, the Pareto Principle is an observational metric. It doesn't speak about what to do a-priori, but it demonstrates the fundamental 
		asymmetry which is ubiquitous in the stuff around us. It makes you think, and if you are like me, inspires you to detect areas of life 
		where you can creatively incorporate asymmetry.
		</p>


		<br><br>


		<p> An asymmetric approach towards life is something that goes against the grain of most people. But then, no philosophy is ever one size 
		fits all. Results are all that matter. That being said, if you are an obsessive kind of person who is restless, wants to do many things with high 
		standards, and are in a way unhinged, this is just the thing for you.
	      	</p>
		
	        <br><br>
		
	      <p>Some instances of Asymmetry I have incorporated in my life:</p>
			
		<br><br>
		
			
		<b>Time restricted eating:</b>
		<p>(Here, relegate 99% of your eating in a small part of the day)
		You leave the decision to measure portions of your food on the clock instead of letting it depend on your cravings
		and moods and volatile willpower.<br>
		A person who tries to balance 2200 calories across multiple meals can never be more consistent long term than a person who restricts
		eating to within a few hours. It takes a calorie surplus of as little as 10 cal a day to compound to 30 extra pounds on you at 45.
		</p>
		
	        <br><br>


	      <b>Diet:</b>
		<p>You should be eating the same simple wholesome food with minor rearrangements for 95% of the time, while eating literally 
		anything for the rest 5% of the time. (In an year, that computes to around 18-20 days)
		</p>

		<br><br>


	      <b>Reading a great book:</b>
		<p>You read hundreds of different books to find the one(or more) that is personally life transforming for you.
		And often, the rest prepare you for that one book.<br>
		(You need to be careful here that no book, no matter how good and how true it seems to you, should become your Bible, 
		including the Bible, Quran, Upanishads/Bhagwat Gita, The Torah, etc)
		</p>

		<br><br>
	      
	      <b>Consistency on Average:</b>
	      <p> Aim for <a href="avgconsis.html">consistency on average</a>. For instance, take reading. 
		  Say you want to read 7 hours a week. Rather than reading an hour everyday, do it in 2 sessions over the weekend, or 
		  even better, one session on, say, Friday night. You have higher chances of hitting a flow-state and having better comprehension and retention.
		  (Imagine watching the complete movie for 3 hrs, or watching 26 min chunks for 7 days. What's better?)
		 
	      </p>
	      
	      <br><br><br>
	      <p>The TL;DR of the whole asymmetry thing is the maxim 'Never half-ass anything. Always full-ass everything'. Looking back, your life
		ought to be an average of extremities, not an average of averages. The former always trends higher than the latter.
	      </p>
