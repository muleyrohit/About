	      <p> The two main purposes behind creating this website are:</p> <br>
	    <ul>
		    <li> To develop a comprehensive picture of my body-of-work.</li> <br>
		    <li> To serve as an alternate, filtered medium of interaction, away from social-media.</li>

	      <h4>Short Introduction:</h4>
	      <br>
		<p>
			I come from an engineering background, which is ironic, for my mental preferences align more towards philosophy and the arts,
			while most of my life was spent obsessed with finance and stock-markets.<br>
			That makes me a chimera of sorts, without a specific niche.

			<!-- I am a monomaniac who wants to do a lot of things with high standards. -->
			I love reading and thinking. I believe in doing things slowly and deliberately, and not ‘figuring things out 
			as I go’. 
			<br><br>


			I am a minimalist, and I prefer fine things. I also enjoy anything that has a rhythm to it, from cooking and music, 
			to even cleaning and tidying up stuff.
			<br>
			I dislike sloppy thinking and regression to defaults.

			
			<br><br>

			I live by the mental-models of the <a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/About/antilyb.html">Anti-Library</a>, 
			<a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/About/nonrsi.html">Non-Rigorous Scientific Intuition</a>, and 
			<a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/About/asymmetry.html">Asymmetry</a>.
			<br><br>

			
			
		
			<!-- I am anti-identity, so I don't attach to any particular doctrine. That being said, I strive to imbibe the Zen concepts of Shoshin(初心) i.e the Beginner’s Mind, 
			and a radical acceptance of ambiguity and paradox as a way of life.
			<br><br>
			-->

			
			I am a great conversationalist and reasonably pleasant company, well, unless you catch me in one of my not infrequent moods. <br>
			But those can easily be taken care of with a nice cup of Coffee :). <br><br><br>

	        <p> I have set up shop at <a href="https://twitter.com/rohitjmuley">Twitter</a></p> to put forth and discuss philosophy, and in general, 
	            classical ideas. Apart from that, my alter ego has been observed moonlighting on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rohitjmuley/">Instagram</a> 
		    servicing the more romantic parts of my psyche.
