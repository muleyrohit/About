	      <p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes about the anti-library in his book The Black Swan. An anti-library is the books you own but 
		haven't read. He bases this on a brilliant essay by Umberto Eco.
		<p>

	     <p>A guest, looking at the huge library at Eco's house, asks if he has read all those books. In an amusing, soft criticism of 
		such questions and such guests, he mentions the contrast in thinking of the library as a storage for already read books and 
		thinking of it as a working tool for research.
		</p>

		<p>Taleb proceeds with the points that books you read are far less valuable than the unread ones. The more you know, larger the 
		rows of unread books. That an Anti-library makes you humble and curious.
		</p>

		<p>A part of growing up means accepting you won't be reading everything you want. That the more you read, larger the rows of unread 
		books are going to be. The same goes with experiences.
		</p>

		<p>No matter what you go through or do, there will always be infinite things you could have gone through or done. The knowledge of how 
		much you won't be able to do or experience in life is an indicator of your growth, and should be read as such, instead of a looming 
		sense of dread.
		</p>

		<p>Ignorance may be bliss, but knowledge is growth.
