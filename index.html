	      <p> The two main purposes behind writing this page are:</p> <br>
	    <ul>
		    <li> To develop a comprehensive picture of my body-of-work.</li> <br>
		    <li> To serve as a filtered medium of interaction, away from social-media.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <p>In addition to that, this page can serve as a peek into who I am apart from the restricted confines of a CV.</p> 
	   
	    <h6>Short Introduction:</h6>
		<p>
			I come from an engineering background, which is ironic, for my mental preferences align more towards philosophy and the fine arts. 
			That makes me a chimera of sorts, without a specific niche. This nudges me towards being a Generalist.
			<br><br>


			I am a monomaniac who wants to do a lot of things with high standards. That can get stressful, so I try to practice both intensity 
			and detachment in everything I do.
			<br><br>

			I am heavily inclined towards reading and thinking. I believe in doing things slowly and deliberately, without ‘figuring things out 
			as I go’. 
			The crux of my philosophy is the amalgamation of form and function in anything. So I have as much of a focus on the aesthetics and beauty 
			as I have on engineering and utility.
			<br><br>


			I am a minimalist, and I love fine things. I also enjoy doing anything that has a pattern and a rhythm to it, be it cooking or music, 
			or even cleaning and tidying up stuff.
			<br><br>

			I hate defeatist attitudes, and in general apathy or zealotry of any kind. I also detest naive optimism and unrefined pessimism.
			<br><br>

			I am a firm practitioner of the mental-models of the Anti-Library, Non-Rigorous Scientific Intuition, Fast and Feast and 
			Asymmetry.
			<br><br>

			I am areligious but not atheist, and I have an academic interest in all religions. 
			I am influenced to a great extent by Hindu philosophy by birth, and since then, by ancient Greek theology and Roman Stoicism.
			I have discovered that the various aspects of my personality together with my interests naturally incline me towards Zen practice.
			Its most appealing aspects to me are the concept of Shoshin(初心) i.e the Beginner’s Mind, and the radical acceptance of ambiguity and 
			paradox in life.
			<br><br>

			
			I am a great conversationalist and pleasant company, well, unless you catch me in one of my not infrequent moods. <br>
			But those can easily be taken care of with a nice cup of Coffee :). <br>
