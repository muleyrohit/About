	      <p> The two main purposes behind creating this website are:</p> <br>
	    <ul>
		    <li> To develop a comprehensive picture of my body-of-work.</li> <br>
		    <li> To serve as an alternate, filtered medium of interaction, away from social-media.</li>

	      <h4>Short Introduction:</h4>
	      <br>
		<p>
			I come from an engineering background, which is ironic, for my mental preferences align more towards philosophy and the fine arts. 
			That makes me a chimera of sorts, without a specific niche. 
			<br><br>


			<!-- I am a monomaniac who wants to do a lot of things with high standards. -->
			I love reading and thinking. I believe in doing things slowly and deliberately, and not ‘figuring things out 
			as I go’. 
			<br><br>


			I am a minimalist, and I prefer fine things. I also enjoy anything that has a rhythm to it, from cooking and music, 
			to even cleaning and tidying up stuff.
			<br>
			I dislike sloppy thinking and regression to defaults.

			
			<br><br>

			I live by the mental-models of the <a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/About/antilyb.html">Anti-Library</a>, 
			<a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/About/nonrsi.html">Non-Rigorous Scientific Intuition</a>, and 
			<a href="https://muleyrohit.github.io/About/asymmetry.html">Asymmetry</a>.
			<br><br>

			
			
		
			<!-- I am anti-identity, so I don't attach to any particular doctrine. That being said, I strive to imbibe the Zen concepts of Shoshin(初心) i.e the Beginner’s Mind, 
			and a radical acceptance of ambiguity and paradox as a way of life.
			<br><br>
			-->

			
			I am a great conversationalist and reasonably pleasant company, well, unless you catch me in one of my not infrequent moods. <br>
			But those can easily be taken care of with a nice cup of Coffee :). <br><br><br>
